# Risk Assessment Matrix for GenAI IDP Accelerator

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive risk assessment matrix that consolidates threats from AI-powered discovery, STRIDE analysis, and pattern-specific analysis. Each threat is evaluated using a consistent risk scoring methodology to enable prioritized security investment decisions.

## Risk Assessment Methodology

### Risk Scoring Framework
**Risk Score = (Impact × Likelihood) + Exploitability Factor + Business Context Multiplier**

### Impact Scale (1-5)
- **5 - Critical**: Complete system compromise, significant data breach, major business disruption
- **4 - High**: Significant security breach, data compromise, business process disruption
- **3 - Medium**: Moderate security impact, limited data exposure, operational disruption
- **2 - Low**: Minor security impact, minimal data exposure, limited operational impact
- **1 - Minimal**: Negligible security impact, no data exposure, no operational impact

### Likelihood Scale (1-5)
- **5 - Very High**: Attack expected imminently, easily exploitable
- **4 - High**: Attack likely in near term, exploitable with moderate effort
- **3 - Medium**: Attack possible, requires specific conditions
- **2 - Low**: Attack unlikely, requires sophisticated attacker
- **1 - Very Low**: Attack highly unlikely, requires nation-state capabilities

### Exploitability Factor (0-2)
- **2**: Publicly available exploits, automated tools exist
- **1**: Requires custom development but feasible
- **0**: Requires significant research and development

### Business Context Multiplier (0.5-2.0)
- **2.0**: Regulated industry (Financial, Healthcare, Government)
- **1.5**: High-value data processing (PII, Financial records)
- **1.0**: Standard business documents
- **0.5**: Low-sensitivity public information
