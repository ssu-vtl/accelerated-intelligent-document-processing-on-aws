### 📖 **Recommended Reading Order:**
1. **[📋 Executive Summary](deliverables/executive-summary.md)** - Start here for business overview
2. **[🏗️ System Architecture](architecture/system-overview.md)** - Understand the system design  
3. **[🎯 STRIDE Analysis](threat-analysis/stride-analysis.md)** - Core threat methodology
4. **[⚖️ Risk Assessment](risk-assessment/risk-matrix.md)** - Risk prioritization and business impact
5. **[🛠️ Implementation Guide](deliverables/implementation-guide.md)** - Technical implementation steps
6. **[📄 Threat Composer Export](deliverables/threat-model.tc.json)** - Machine-readable threat model

## Methodology
This threat model follows a hybrid approach combining:
1. **AI-Powered Discovery** - Using Threat Designer for comprehensive threat identification
2. **Structured Analysis** - Using Threat Composer's systematic threat grammar
3. **Industry Standards** - STRIDE methodology and AWS Well-Architected security principles

## Processing Patterns Analyzed
- **Pattern 1**: Bedrock Data Automation (BDA) end-to-end processing
- **Pattern 2**: Amazon Textract + AWS Bedrock (classification and extraction)
- **Pattern 3**: Amazon Textract + SageMaker (UDOP) + AWS Bedrock

## Key Focus Areas
- Document-borne security threats
- AI/ML model exploitation vectors
- Serverless architecture vulnerabilities
- API security (AppSync GraphQL)
- Authentication and authorization
- Data protection and privacy
- Compliance considerations (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX)
