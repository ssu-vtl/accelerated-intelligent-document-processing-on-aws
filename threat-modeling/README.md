## Methodology
This threat model follows a hybrid approach combining:
1. **AI-Powered Discovery** - Using Threat Designer for comprehensive threat identification
2. **Structured Analysis** - Using Threat Composer's systematic threat grammar
3. **Industry Standards** - STRIDE methodology and AWS Well-Architected security principles

## Processing Patterns Analyzed
- **Pattern 1**: Bedrock Data Automation (BDA) end-to-end processing
- **Pattern 2**: Amazon Textract + AWS Bedrock (classification and extraction)
- **Pattern 3**: Amazon Textract + SageMaker (UDOP) + AWS Bedrock

## Key Focus Areas
- Document-borne security threats
- AI/ML model exploitation vectors
- Serverless architecture vulnerabilities
- API security (AppSync GraphQL)
- Authentication and authorization
- Data protection and privacy
- Compliance considerations (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX)

## Status
- ✅ Phase 1: Architecture Analysis (Complete)
- ✅ Phase 2: AI-Powered Threat Discovery (Complete)
