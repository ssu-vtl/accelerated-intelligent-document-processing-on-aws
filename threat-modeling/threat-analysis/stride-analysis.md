## Cross-Component STRIDE Patterns

### 1. Cross-Service Authentication Chains
**Pattern**: S → T → I → E
- **Spoofing** service identities leads to **Tampering** with data flows
- **Information Disclosure** of credentials enables **Elevation** of privileges

### 2. Data Flow Contamination
**Pattern**: T → I → D
- **Tampering** with processing data causes **Information Disclosure**
- Leads to **Denial of Service** through corrupted outputs

### 3. Resource Exhaustion Cascade
**Pattern**: D → D → D
- **Denial of Service** in one component cascades to dependent services
- Creates system-wide availability issues
