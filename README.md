## Introduction

A scalable, serverless solution for automated document processing and information extraction using AWS services. This system combines OCR capabilities with generative AI to convert unstructured documents into structured data at scale.

## Key Features

- **Serverless Architecture**: Built entirely on AWS serverless technologies including Lambda, Step Functions, SQS, and DynamoDB
- **Modular, pluggable patterns**: Pre-built processing patterns using state-of-the-art models and AWS services
- **Advanced Classification**: Support for page-level and holistic document packet classification
- **Few Shot Example Support**: Improve accuracy through example-based prompting
- **High Throughput Processing**: Handles large volumes of documents through intelligent queuing
- **Built-in Resilience**: Comprehensive error handling, retries, and throttling management
- **Cost Optimization**: Pay-per-use pricing model with built-in controls
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Rich CloudWatch dashboard with detailed metrics and logs
- **Web User Interface**: Modern UI for inspecting document workflow status and results
- **AI-Powered Evaluation**: Framework to assess accuracy against baseline data
- **Document Knowledge Base Query**: Ask questions about your processed documents

## Architecture Overview

![Architecture Diagram](./images/IDP.drawio.png)

The solution uses a modular architecture with nested CloudFormation stacks to support multiple document processing patterns while maintaining common infrastructure for queueing, tracking, and monitoring.

Current patterns include:
- Pattern 1: Packet or Media processing with Bedrock Data Automation (BDA)
- Pattern 2: OCR → Bedrock Classification (page-level or holistic) → Bedrock Extraction
- Pattern 3: OCR → UDOP Classification (SageMaker) → Bedrock Extraction

## Quick Start

To quickly deploy the GenAI-IDP solution in your AWS account:

1. Log into the [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)
2. Choose the **Launch Stack** button below for your desired region:

| Region name           | Region code | Launch                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| US West (Oregon)      | us-west-2   | [![Launch Stack](https://cdn.rawgit.com/buildkite/cloudformation-launch-stack-button-svg/master/launch-stack.svg)](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-2#/stacks/create/review?templateURL=https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aws-ml-blog-us-west-2/artifacts/genai-idp/idp-main.yaml&stackName=IDP) |

3. When the stack deploys for the first time, you'll receive an email with a temporary password to access the web UI
4. Use this temporary password for your first login to set up a permanent password

### Processing Your First Document

After deployment, you can quickly process a document and view results:

1. **Upload a Document**:
   - **Via Web UI**: Open the Web UI URL from the CloudFormation stack's Outputs tab, log in, and click "Upload Document"
   - **Via S3**: Upload directly to the S3 input bucket (find the bucket URL in CloudFormation stack Outputs)

2. **Use Sample Documents**:
   - For Pattern 1 (BDA): Use `samples/lending_package.pdf`
   - For Patterns 2 and 3: Use `samples/rvl_cdip_package.pdf` 

3. **Monitor Processing**:
   - **Via Web UI**: Track document status on the dashboard
   - **Via Step Functions**: Open the StateMachine URL from CloudFormation stack Outputs to observe workflow execution

4. **View Results**:
   - **Via Web UI**: Access processing results through the document details page
   - **Via S3**: Check the output bucket for structured JSON files with extracted data

See the [Deployment Guide](./docs/deployment.md#testing-the-solution) for more detailed testing instructions.

## Updating an Existing Deployment

To update an existing GenAIIDP stack to a new version:

1. Navigate to CloudFormation in the AWS Management Console
2. Select your existing stack
3. Click "Update"
4. Select "Replace current template"
5. Enter the template URL: `https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aws-ml-blog-us-west-2/artifacts/genai-idp/idp-main.yaml`
6. Follow the prompts to update your stack, reviewing any parameter changes
7. For detailed instructions, see the [Deployment Guide](./docs/deployment.md#updating-an-existing-stack)

For testing, use these sample files:
- Pattern-1 BDA default project: `samples/lending_package.pdf`
- Patterns 2 and 3 default configurations: `samples/rvl_cdip_package.pdf`

For detailed deployment and testing instructions, see the [Deployment Guide](./docs/deployment.md).
