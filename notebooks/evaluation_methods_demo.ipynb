    "The smart attribute discovery and evaluation feature provides the following benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Auto-discovery of attributes**\n",
    "   - Finds attributes not explicitly defined in the configuration\n",
    "   - Compares all data fields across expected and actual results\n",
    "   - Works with minimal or even no attribute configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Default Evaluation Method**\n",
    "   - Applies LLM method to unconfigured attributes by default \n",
    "   - Provides semantic comparison for discovered attributes\n",
    "   - Attaches explanations that the attribute was not in configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handles All Possible Cases**\n",
    "   - Attributes in both expected and actual results\n",
    "   - Attributes only in expected results (false negatives)\n",
    "   - Attributes only in actual results (false positives)\n",
    "   - Attributes that don't exist in either (true negatives)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Benefits**\n",
    "   - Exploratory evaluation without complete configuration\n",
    "   - Comprehensive metrics that include all found attributes\n",
    "   - Flexibility as extraction models evolve or change output formats\n",
    "   - Identification of potential new attributes to add to configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature is particularly useful during the early stages of implementation when the complete attribute schema may not be fully defined, or when handling variations in extraction outputs that contain unexpected information."
