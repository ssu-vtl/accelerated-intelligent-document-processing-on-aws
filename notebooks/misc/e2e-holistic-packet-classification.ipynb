    "# Holistic Packet Classification with IDP Common Package\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the holistic packet classification capability of the IDP Common Package to classify multi-document packets, where each document might span multiple pages. The holistic approach examines the document as a whole to identify boundaries between different document types within the packet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Benefits of Holistic Packet Classification:**\n",
    "1. Properly handles multi-page documents within a packet\n",
    "2. Detects logical document boundaries\n",
    "3. Identifies document types in context of the whole document\n",
    "4. Handles documents where individual pages may not be clearly classifiable on their own\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook demonstrates how to process a document with:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. OCR Service - Convert a PDF document to text using AWS Textract\n",
    "2. Classification Service - Classify document pages into sections using Bedrock using the multi-model page based method.\n",
    "3. Extraction Service - Extract structured information from sections using Bedrock\n",
    "4. Evaluation Service - Evaluate accuracy of extracted information\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step uses the unified Document object model for data flow and consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: This notebook uses AWS services including S3, Textract, and Bedrock. You need valid AWS credentials with appropriate permissions to run this notebook."

Smoke cigarettes to a 23 - butt length, or to the length of the filter and overwrap plus 3 mm. if in excess of 23 -. \\n2. Base results on a test of 100 cigarettes per brand, or type, \\n3. Cigarettes to be tested will be selected on a random basis, as opposed to \"weight selection,\" \\n4. Determine particulate matter on a \"dry\" basis employing the gas chromatography method published by C. H. Sloan and B. J. Sublett in Tobacco Science 9, page 70, 1965, as modified by F. J. Schultz\\' and A. W. Spears\\' report published in Tobacco Vol. 162, No. 24, page 32, dated June 17, 1966, to determine the moisture content, \\n5. Determine and report the \"tar\" content after subtracting moisture and alkaloids (as nicotine) from particulate matter. \\n6. Report tar content to the nearest whole milligram and nicotine content to the nearest 1/10 milligrams. \\nThe Commission directed that the test cover approximately 50 of the major brands and types (many brands are sold as regular, and king size, or filter, etc.) and all brands for which any tar or nicotine statement appears on the label or in the advertising. With respect to the latter, one purpose of the test will be to determine the accuracy of such statement. Cigarettes for testing will be purchased on the open market in 50 localities throughout the United States. \\nIn determining the foregoing procedures, the Commission relied substan- tially upon a record including written presentation by interested persons and oral testimony offered at a public hearing on November 30, 1966, which was held \"to assist the Commission in determining what action, if any, should be taken in the public interest with respect to modifying or amplifying the Cambridge Filter Method. and the form in which test results should be expressed.\" At the hearing the Commission received numerous submissions re- flecting a variety of modifications of the Cambridge Filter Method that have been adopted by different groups engaged in testing cigarettes. No test can precisely duplicate conditions of actual human smoking and, within fairly wide limits, no one method can be said to be either \"right\" or \"wrong.\" The Commission considers it most important that the test results be based on a reasonable standardized method and that they be capable of being presented to the public in a manner that is readily understandable. Although minor variations may not make one testing method \"better\" than another, the public \\nyour to Mission Byown Apples a Wolfe, Lane A7h7 \\n00 \\n\\nfrom Public Health ack\\n\\nBearing FTC July hise adv\\n\\n\\n<page-number>7</page-number>\\n# PLEASE TELL US WHAT YOU THINK \\n\\nHow satisfied were you in each of the following areas: \\n\\nNeither\\n\\nVery Somewhat Satisfied Nor Somewhat\\nVery\\n Satisfied Satisfied Dissatisfied Dissatisfied Dissatisfied\\n\\n1.

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the end-to-end processing flow using AWS services and the unified Document model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document Creation** - Initialize a Document object with input/output locations\n",
    "2. **OCR Processing** - Convert PDF to text using AWS Textract via OcrService\n",
    "3. **Classification** - Identify document types and sections with Claude via ClassificationService\n",
    "4. **Extraction** - Extract structured information with Claude via ExtractionService\n",
    "5. **Evaluation** - Compare extraction results against expected values and generate metrics\n",
    "6. **Document Model** - Document object is consistently used between all services\n",
    "7. **Result Storage** - Extraction results are stored in S3 with URIs tracked in the Document\n",
    "\n",
    "Key benefits of this approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modularity** - Each service has a clear responsibility\n",
    "2. **Consistency** - Same data model flows through the entire pipeline\n",
    "3. **Performance** - Focused document pattern reduces resource usage\n",
    "4. **Flexibility** - Support for multiple backends (Bedrock, SageMaker)\n",
    "5. **Maintainability** - Standardized patterns across services\n",
    "6. **Measurement** - Built-in evaluation capabilities to measure accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "This example uses a  workflow with:\n",
    "1. S3 buckets (created specifically for this demo)\n",
    "2. AWS Textract OCR processing\n",
    "3. LLM inferencing via Bedrock\n",
    "4. A document sample (rvl_cdip_package.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Evaluation Service specifically provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Multiple evaluation methods (EXACT, NUMERIC_EXACT, FUZZY)\n",
    "2. Per-attribute and document-level metrics\n",
    "3. Markdown and JSON format reporting\n",
    "4. Integration with the Document model\n",
    "5. Configuration-driven evaluation methods"
