    "# Step 2: Multimodal Page Classification with Boundary Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to classify document pages and detect page-level document boundaries using the `multimodalPageLevelClassification` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- Multimodal classification using both text and images\n",
    "- Document boundary detection (start/continue)\n",
    "- Section creation based on both document type changes AND boundary markers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inputs:**\n",
    "- Document object with OCR results from Step 1\n",
    "- Configuration with boundary detection enabled\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outputs:**\n",
    "- Document with classifications and boundary markers\n",
    "- Sections respecting document boundaries"
