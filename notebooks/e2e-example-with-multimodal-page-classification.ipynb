    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the end-to-end processing flow using AWS services and the unified Document model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document Creation** - Initialize a Document object with input/output locations\n",
    "2. **OCR Processing** - Convert PDF to text using AWS Textract via OcrService\n",
    "3. **Classification** - Identify document types and sections with Claude via ClassificationService\n",
    "4. **Extraction** - Extract structured information with Claude via ExtractionService\n",
    "5. **Evaluation** - Compare extraction results against expected values and generate metrics\n",
    "6. **Document Model** - Document object is consistently used between all services\n",
    "7. **Result Storage** - Extraction results are stored in S3 with URIs tracked in the Document\n",
    "\n",
    "Key benefits of this approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modularity** - Each service has a clear responsibility\n",
    "2. **Consistency** - Same data model flows through the entire pipeline\n",
    "3. **Performance** - Focused document pattern reduces resource usage\n",
    "4. **Flexibility** - Support for multiple backends (Bedrock, SageMaker)\n",
    "5. **Maintainability** - Standardized patterns across services\n",
    "6. **Measurement** - Built-in evaluation capabilities to measure accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "This example uses a  workflow with:\n",
    "1. S3 buckets (created specifically for this demo)\n",
    "2. AWS Textract OCR processing\n",
    "3. LLM inferencing via Bedrock\n",
    "4. A document sample (rvl_cdip_package.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Evaluation Service specifically provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Multiple evaluation methods (EXACT, NUMERIC_EXACT, FUZZY)\n",
    "2. Per-attribute and document-level metrics\n",
    "3. Markdown and JSON format reporting\n",
    "4. Integration with the Document model\n",
    "5. Configuration-driven evaluation methods"
