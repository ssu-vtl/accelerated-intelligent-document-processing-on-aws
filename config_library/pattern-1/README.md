# Pattern 1 Configurations

This directory contains configurations for Pattern 1 of the GenAI IDP Accelerator, which uses Amazon Bedrock Data Automation (BDA) for document processing tasks.

## Pattern 1 Overview

Pattern 1 implements an intelligent document processing workflow using Amazon Bedrock Data Automation (BDA) for orchestrating ML-powered document processing tasks. It leverages BDA's ability to extract insights from documents using pre-configured templates and workflows.

Key components of Pattern 1:
- BDA Invoke Lambda that starts BDA jobs asynchronously with a task token
- BDA Completion Lambda that processes job completion events from EventBridge
- Process Results Lambda that copies output files to designated location

## Adding Configurations

To add a new configuration for Pattern 1:

1. Create a new directory with a descriptive name
2. Include a config.json file with the appropriate settings
3. Add a README.md file using the template from `../TEMPLATE_README.md`
4. Include sample documents in a samples/ directory

See the main [README.md](../README.md) for more detailed instructions on creating and contributing configurations.

## Available Configurations

Currently, there are no configurations available for Pattern 1. Contributions are welcome!
