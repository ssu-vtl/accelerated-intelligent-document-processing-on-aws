# Pattern 3 Configurations

This directory contains configurations for Pattern 3 of the GenAI IDP Accelerator, which uses UDOP (Unified Document Processing) for page classification and grouping, followed by Claude for information extraction.

## Pattern 3 Overview

Pattern 3 implements an intelligent document processing workflow that uses UDOP (Unified Document Processing) for page classification and grouping, followed by Claude for information extraction.

Key components of Pattern 3:
- OCR processing using Amazon Textract
- Page classification and grouping using a UDOP model deployed on SageMaker
- Field extraction using Claude via Amazon Bedrock
