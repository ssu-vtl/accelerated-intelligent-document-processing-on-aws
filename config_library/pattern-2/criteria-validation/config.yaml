    You are a specialized insurance evaluator tasked with determining the eligibility of insurance coverage based on a patient's user history and a set of criterias. 
    Each evaluation should be supported by precise reasoning, with citations from the user history where applicable.
  
  task_prompt: |
    Consider the patients user history inforamtion provided insided <user_history></user_history> XML tags.

    <user_history>
     <source_filepath>
     {source_filepath}
     </source_filepath>

     <content>
     {content}
     </content>
    </user_history>

    <criteria>
    <criteria_type>
    {criteria_type}
    </criteria_type>

    <question>
    {question}
    </question>
    </criteria>

    <instruction>
    Evaluate the patient's insurance eligibility for each question provided insided <question></question> XML tags  and patients user history information provided inside <user_history></user_history> XML tags. 

    Your Task:

    For each question, provide:

    Decision: Carefully review each requirement in the context of the patient's user history to decide if it is "Pass," "Fail," or "Information Not Found" and select one of the following options:

    {recommendation_options}

    Reasoning: Provide a brief explanation for the decision, highlighting any relevant details or absence of data.
    Citations: When applicable, cite specific sections of the user history (e.g., page numbers, sections, S3 URI) that support your decision.

    Json Response format:
    {{
     "criteria_type" : "question/criteria type mentioned inside <criteria_type></criteria_type> XML tags"
     "source_file" : ["list of source_filepath that supports the recommendation"]
     "question" : "question Description"
     "Recommendation" : "This should be one of the following: Pass, Fail, or Information Not Found"
     "Reasoning" : "Provide a thorough explanation, reasoning, and any citations from the source_file in a Single  paragraph explanation without line breaks"
    }}
    All fields must be included in the JSON response, even if some values are unavailable (leave them as empty strings if necessary).
    Ensure that the output is a valid JSON object and strictly adheres to the format provided above.
    criteria_type must be included as a field within the JSON and not as the primary key.
    The reasoning field must include detailed explanations and citations to support the decision.

    </instruction>

    Follow instructions provided inside <instruction></instruction> XML tags. 
    Provide the output in a Json format inside <response></response> XML tags. Do not include any space after <response> tag and before </response> tag.

  # Criteria definitions nested under criteria_validation
  criteria:

      - "Will the immunotherapy be administered under the supervision of an appropriately trained physician?"
      - "Is the facility equipped to treat anaphylaxis?"
      - "Has the physician determined an appropriate dosage regimen and progression schedule?"
      - "Are there adequate safety protocols in place for infusion reactions?"
    medical_necessity:
      - "Has the patient failed standard treatments?"
      - "Is the proposed treatment medically necessary?"
      - "Does the patient meet the clinical criteria for this treatment?"
    dosage_requirements:
      - "Is the dosage appropriate for the patient's condition?"
      - "Has the physician documented the rationale for the selected dosage?"
      - "Are dosage adjustments based on patient response documented?"
    safety_requirements:
      - "Are safety protocols adequate for the proposed treatment?"
      - "Has the patient been screened for contraindications?"
      - "Are monitoring procedures in place during treatment?"
    
    # Recommendation options under criteria
    recommendation_options: |
      Pass: The requirement criteria are fully met.
      Fail: The requirement is partially met or requires additional information.
      Information Not Found: No relevant data exists in the user history.

# Summary configuration for multiple files
summary:
  system_prompt: |
    You are a specialized patient user insurance auth request evaluator
    You will assist in summarizing important patient user insurance auth request information determining the eligibility of insurance coverage based on a patient's user history and a set of questions/criterias. 
    You will be given a question (<question>) and the initial LLM responses (<initial_response>) that has information for one or more patient user history text documents.
    Your task is to evaluate and identify the important and relevant information from the related information to sufficiently answer the given question/criteria.
  
  task_prompt: |
    <criteria>
    <criteria_type>{criteria_type}</criteria_type>
    <question>{question}</question>
    </criteria

    <initial_response>
    {initial_response}
    </initial_response>

    <instructions>
    Analyze the provided criteria and initial response to generate a consolidated final evaluation, considering all available evidence to reach a single determination for each unique criterion.
    Multiple instances of the same question/criteria may appear within a category, often referencing different source files. 

    {recommendation_options}

    JSON RESPONSE FORMAT 

    {{
     "criteria_type" : "question/criteria type mentioned inside <criteria_type></criteria_type> XML tags"
     "source_file" : ["list of source_filepath that supports the recommendation"]
     "question" : "question Description"
     "Recommendation" : "This should be one of the following: Pass, Fail, or Information Not Found"
     "Reasoning" : "Provide a thorough explanation, reasoning, and any citations from the source_file in a Single paragraph explanation without line breaks"
    }}

    SOURCE FILE RULES:
    1. Include ONLY files that contain relevant information for the question/criteria
    2. If no information is found, source_file should be an empty list []
    3. For 'Fail' recommendations, include files that were reviewed and led to the failure decision
    4. For partial information, include only files containing the relevant documentation
    5. Cite specific evidence from each listed file in the reasoning

    RESPONSE RULES:
    1. Provide a single consolidated evaluation
    2. Include all source files that support the recommendation
    3. Keep reasoning concise and in a single paragraph
    4. Use only basic punctuation (. , : ;)
    5. Avoid special characters or line breaks in reasoning
    6. Base recommendation strictly on documented evidence
    7. All JSON fields must be included
    8. For 'Fail' or partial findings, explicitly state what documentation was missing or insufficient

    EVALUATION STEPS:
    1. Review initial response and evidence
    2. Identify files containing relevant information
    3. Determine final recommendation
          - If evidence clearly shows PASS, mark as PASS
          - If any evidence indicates FAIL, mark as FAIL
          - If mixed FAIL and "Information Not Found" for same criteria, use FAIL
          - Only use "Information Not Found" if no evidence at all is found
    4. List only files with supporting evidence
    5. Summarize reasoning with specific citations
    6. Format response as valid JSON

    </instruction>
    Follow instructions provided inside <instruction></instruction> XML tags. 
    Let's think step by step to analyze the question/criteria.
    Provide the output in a Json format inside <response></response> XML tags.
